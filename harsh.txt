My favorite code quote, "<span id="k">"The ideal engineer is a composite ... He is not a scientist, he is not a mathematician, he is not a sociologist or a writer, but he may use the knowledge and techniques of any or all of these disciplines in solving engineering problems." - N. W. Dougherty.</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
